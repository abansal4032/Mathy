The program is able to 1) read arbitrary postfix expressions from the client command line,
2) have the client transmit the expression to a server where the computation will be performed, 3)
have the server return the answer to the client, and 4) have the client print the answer to the screen.
The client will not do any calculation but will instead send a request to the server to be calculated.
